To get meaningful result, this correlation should really be above 0.97. If this is not the case, consider the output of ExomeDepth as less reliable (i.e. most likely a high false positive rate)
Optimization of the choice of aggregate reference set, this process can take some time
Number of selected bins: 7
Now fitting the beta-binomial model on a data frame with 10 rows : this step can take a few minutes.
